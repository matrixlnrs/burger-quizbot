# Burger QuizBot

This project is due on the 18th of December and is worth 40% of our final grade.

Objective: Build an interactive console-based quiz chat-bot in C language that allows users to answer questions, track their score, and save their progress. All user data, history, and quiz questions are stored in files managed by the system.
